In December 2014, LADWP started its WaterSmart Pilot Study, which is a behavior efficiency program that aims to educate customers on their water use and the need to conserve through focused outreach through bi-monthly Home Water Reports. These Home Water Reports detail how much water the customer is using, how they compare to homes of similar size and climate, the water reduction required to get to efficient levels, and provide customized water saving tips and rebate recommendations.  LADWP started an AMI pilot program in April 2015 which will ultimately include the installation of around 600 smart meters on targeted customers within the next 18 months.  LADWP started a Water Loss Task Force recently to evaluate various options for improving water loss control and reducing water losses in LADWP’s water distribution system. The report is planned for completion in Fall 2015 and will be presented to management for approval of cost-effective actions.

Directors adopted Ordinance 33 on May 12, 2010. Ordinance 33 includes MVWD's water shortage contingency plan, as well as year-round, permanent, and mandatory water use requirements. These permanent requirements, which went into effect upon adoption of Ordinance 33, include all of the water use restrictions in the State Board's emergency regulations, and allow outdoor irrigation only between 8pm-8am for no more than 15 minutes per cycle. On March 12, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 676-14, which took public action to recognize statewide drought conditions.   In order to assist customers in reducing their outdoor water use, MVWD offers a variety of programs, including free irrigation evaluations, free high-efficiency sprinkler nozzles, free weather-based irrigation controller and nozzle installations, turf removal, and water-efficient device rebates for all customer classes. In response to the drought, MVWD has scheduled four “Drought Response Clinics” over the next four months where customers can receive one-on-one assistance with program signups and rebates, and participate in bilingual gardening mini-classes and demonstration garden tours to learn more about water-efficient plants.   MVWD has sent a direct mail bilingual letter to its customers providing information on the State’s emergency drought regulations, MVWD’s existing mandatory water use requirements, and how they can reduce water use. Included in the mailer is a bilingual flyer on the Drought Response Clinics, specifically targeting customers with limited or no Internet access. MVWD provides recommended seasonal irrigation schedules through customer bills, at the customer service counter, and on our website.      In 2010, MVWD successfully implemented a budget-based tiered water rate for its single-family residential customers. Customers receive an Efficient/Inefficient rating on each bill, as well as their budget (Tier 1 and Tier 2) allocation for the following billing period.   MVWD has already achieved its 20% urban water use reduction requirement as called for under SBX7-7 (2009).
