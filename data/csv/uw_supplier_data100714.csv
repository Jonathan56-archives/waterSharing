Irrigation between the hours of 9:00am to 6:00pm   Due to our heavy clay soils, and steep slopes this is a more effective measure than days per week due to the needs of cycle and soak irrigation practices that can cross days to avoid irrigation during hottest parts of the day.

The Yucaipa Valley Water District is in the process of preparing a joint Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Yucaipa and the City of Calimesa for implementing coordinated water conservation efforts with code enforcement personnel.  The MOU will be considered at the YVWD board meeting on September 17, 2014.  ","In July 2014, the Yucaipa Valley Water District offset and reduced water demands by 13% with the use of recycled water to our community.  The reported recycled water use is by direct delivery to customers and not by indirect reuse (spreading or recharge).  The use of recycled water conserves drinking water supplies during wet, normal and dry years and has reduced the amount of water that would have been typically produced from local groundwater sources.  Please consider adding the amount of recycled water in Questions 11 to the spreadsheets reported to the public to illustrate how much recycled water is being consumed by each public agency.",58.16,MG," 409,590,000 "," 483,180,000 ",88%,No Correction NeededCalifornia Water Service Company Kern River Valley,2,No,Aug-14,97,108,AF,,5776,,,,," 31,607,588 "," 35,191,954 ",89%,No Correction NeededCalifornia Water Service Company Los Altos/Suburban,2,No,Aug-14,1467,1678,AF,,67940,,,,," 478,024,043 "," 546,778,695 ",76%,No Correction NeededCalifornia Water Service Company Livermore,2,No,Aug-14,860,1363,AF,,56055,,,,," 280,232,227 "," 444,135,495 ",75%,No Correction NeededWest Kern Water District,Stage 2,Yes,Aug-14,1881,1991,AF,,16306,,,,," 612,926,534 "," 648,770,191 ",17%,No Correction NeededPaso Robles  City of,2,Yes,Aug-14,233.357,267.569,MG,,30072,,"We implemented mandatory restrictions in 2009 due to water shortage issues.

Additionally, a bill stuffer was included enumerating the â€œFour things Californians can do to save water in the droughtâ€ù, with another bill stuffer promoting free home water surveys and rebates for landscape efficiency.    The City launched a mobile app this month, enabling residents to report leaks and waste, and updated the conservation page on the City Web site to reflect the declaration of Stage 2, and guide residents to rebates and assistance.  Staff was informed of the declaration, and a handout provided to be placed on public counters detailing the restrictions in place.  City landscape crews have been informed about the regulations and restrictions, and directed to be diligent in checking irrigations systems and performing prompt repairs. Lawn signs have been ordered, to publicize the turf removal program throughout the City.    City staff responded to numerous email and telephone inquiries about the drought, met with Homeowner Association representatives, and continues scheduling workshops and public forums to take place over the next several months.

Included in the mailer is a bilingual flyer on the Drought Response Clinics, specifically targeting customers with limited or no Internet access. MVWD provides recommended seasonal irrigation schedules through customer bills, at the customer service counter, and on our website.

Customers receive an ""Efficient/Inefficient"" rating on each bill, as well as their budget (Tier 1 and Tier 2) allocation for the following billing period.

On March 12, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 676-14, which took public action to recognize statewide drought conditions.     In order to assist customers in reducing their outdoor water use, MVWD offers a variety of programs, including free irrigation evaluations, free high-efficiency sprinkler nozzles, free weather-based irrigation controller and nozzle installations, turf removal, and water-efficient device rebates for all customer classes. In response to the drought, MVWD has scheduled four â€œDrought Response Clinicsâ€ù over the next four months where customers can receive one-on-one assistance with program signups and rebates, and participate in bilingual gardening mini-classes and demonstration garden tours to learn more about water-efficient plants.

MVWD provides recommended seasonal irrigation schedules through customer bills, at the customer service counter, and on our website.
