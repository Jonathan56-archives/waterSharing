The “Save the Drop” Campaign continues its partnership with celebrities Steve Carell, Jaime Camil, and Moby, with new public service announcements airing on TV, cinema, and radio.

"440","Monte Vista Water District","1","Jun-14",1005,992,"AF",54460,"The MVWD Board of Directors adopted Ordinance 33 on May 12, 2010. Ordinance 33 includes MVWD's water shortage contingency plan, as well as year-round, permanent, and mandatory water use requirements. These permanent requirements, which went into effect upon adoption of Ordinance 33, include all of the water use restrictions in the State Board's emergency regulations, and allow outdoor irrigation only between 8pm-8am for no more than 15 minutes per cycle. On March 12, 2014, the Board adopted Resolution 676-14, which took public action to recognize statewide drought conditions.   In order to assist customers in reducing their outdoor water use, MVWD offers a variety of programs, including free irrigation evaluations, free high-efficiency sprinkler nozzles, free weather-based irrigation controller and nozzle installations, turf removal, and water-efficient device rebates for all customer classes. In response to the drought, MVWD has scheduled four “Drought Response Clinics” over the next four months where customers can receive one-on-one assistance with program signups and rebates, and participate in bilingual gardening mini-classes and demonstration garden tours to learn more about water-efficient plants.   MVWD has sent a direct mail bilingual letter to its customers providing information on the State’s emergency drought regulations, MVWD’s existing mandatory water use requirements, and how they can reduce water use. Included in the mailer is a bilingual flyer on the Drought Response Clinics, specifically targeting customers with limited or no Internet access. MVWD provides recommended seasonal irrigation schedules through customer bills, at the customer service counter, and on our website.      In 2010, MVWD successfully implemented a budget-based tiered water rate for its single-family residential customers. Customers receive an Efficient/Inefficient rating on each bill, as well as their budget (Tier 1 and Tier 2) allocation for the following billing period.   MVWD has already achieved its 20% urban water use reduction requirement as called for under SBX7-7 (2009).

San Juan also hired additional staff to perform water waste patrol in the early morning hours and throughout the day. For the top 100 water users, San Juan is reading meters more frequently and notifying the customers if water reductions are not achieved. Staff also reviews usage at each meter reading looking for customers who have used noticeably more water than the previous month or the same time last year. Water used for mandatory flushing is now available to contractors for their “Sprinkling/Irrigation” needs. Per Environmental Agency standards, sprinkling the ground surface with water until it is moist serves an effective dust control method for haul roads and other traffic routes (Smolen et al., 1988) and this practice can be applied to almost any construction site.","NULL",36.778261,-119.4179324,1624321078.1612,2594293107.25588,0.0517572613292458,49585.4776897612,0.01276402098399,"Aug","14","Aug14"

In fiscal 2013/14, EMWD added nearly 1,700 retail water connections.  At an average demand of 0.45 AFY per connection, we would expect to see an increase in demand of 765 AFY just from new development alone.  In addition, the average ET was 7.15 inches in June of 2013 and 7.79 inches in July of 2013 compared to 8.28 inches and 8.06 inches in June and July of 2014, a 3-15% increase.  Higher actual ET values means that plants need addition water to remain healthy.  Higher ET values also increase customer allocation under EMWD’s tiered rate. Even with the additional customers and an increase in ET, EMWD only saw a 3.4% in in retail water production.

Bakman also went live this month with a customer usage portal where customers can login and see their usage while also setting alarms and reminders. As Bakman continues installing meters, the ability to quantify use by individual and/or user category increases and becomes more efficient, especially considering that billing is done on a bi-monthly (every 2 months) basis and prior to the new technology, metered services were read every two months via handheld driving by. New meter technology sends reads to the office automatically and can be tracked on a daily basis allowing for more opportunity to segment user classes and once fully metered will enable better tracking of non-revenue water.","NULL",36.778261,-119.4179324,346719686.416426,581756196.720319,0.0110478535673279,24836.6537547583,0.00639331482659668,"May","15","May15"

In March of 2015, Council adopted the new Water Shortage Contingency Ordinance which further restricted times allotted to outdoor irrigation.  We have streamlined our water waste reporting system to achieve better response times to reports of water waste.  Our outreach programs include direct mailing of multiple guidelines and factsheets, press releases, and numerous appearances on local radio and television news programs.  To increase visibility of enforcement actions, the City of Redding has contracted with a local security agency to provide city-wide patrols to identify violations of the Water Shortage Contingency Ordinance.  Beginning July 15, these patrol officers will drive assigned neighborhoods and report on violations using a standardized form and digital image of the violation.  City staff will follow-up on these reports with warning door hangers and phone calls.","36%",40.581071,-122.3908598,2914351255.99988,4186476992.26262,0.0928626991239672,31953.153332528,0.00822520501250013,"Jun","15","Jun15"
